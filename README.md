# matrix-rs

This is really a toy project to give me an excuse to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It's an attempt to make a Rust
implementation of a [Matrix](http://matrix.org/) homeserver. There's already [a project to do this](https://github.com/ruma/ruma),
but I wanted to learn Rust via a green field project (not to mention not wanting to burden anyone else with having to deal with my
Rust n00b code).
